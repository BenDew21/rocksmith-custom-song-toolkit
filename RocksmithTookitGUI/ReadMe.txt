Welcome to the Song Creator Toolkit for Rocksmith.
More commonly known as the Rocksmith Toolkit, or
more simply as, 'the toolkit'.

Drag and drop the 'RocksmithToolkit' folder anywhere
onto your computer, such as, Desktop, My Documents, or 
Programs Files folder.  There is no installer to run.

The toolkit does not use, or modify the system registry
in any way.  The program is completely portable.
You can even run it from a USB stick if you want to.

Open the 'RocksmithToolkit' folder and double click on
the application name/icon 'RocksmithToolkitGUI.exe' to
launch the program.  You can create a shortcut, and place
it anywhere to make the program easier to launch.
