# How to contribute

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Create an [issue](https://github.com/rscustom/rocksmith-custom-song-toolkit/issues) for the bug/feature if doesn't already exist
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Submitting Changes

* For minor changes (single line fixes, typos etc) an issue isn't needed. Only create an issue for more substantial changes.

* Push your changes to your fork of the repository.
  * Include the issue number somewhere in the first line of the commit message
  * While the issue should have details about what you're doing, make your commit message meaningful rather than something like "Fixes #1234"
  * A good commit message might be something like `Adds support for Drop D tuning (#1234)`
* Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to the rscustom repository.
